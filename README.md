Bit Target Job Search
=====================

The Bit Target Job Search app is designed to give the user
a simple way to search niche job postings. While there are 
huge job search websites such as Monster and Indeed, many 
great Web Developer jobs are posted on coder sites such as
Github Jobs and Stack Overflow Jobs. This is where 
Bit Target Jobs comes into play.

Why not just use those other sites to search?
---------------------------------------------

Whether you are looking for your first developer job
or trying to advance your career, the last thing you want
to do is waste time searching through multiple websites.
Bit Target Job Search is all about allowing the user to 
quickly and easily put job postings infront of them in 
on place. Rather than digging through Github Jobs,
the user search puts exactly what they need infront of
them in seconds.

Technical Specs
===============

Bit Target Job Search was built using a multitude of 
Front End Web technologies to included:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Github Jobs API

Core Technical Specs
--------------------

At it's core Bit Target is a job search that uses API's to 
access job data. At this time the Github Jobs API is being 
accessed through a AJAX and json query. We are working on 
adding the Stack Overflow Jobs RSS feed in the future.


Where will we go from here?
===========================

While we hope you enjoy this web app now, we want
to continue to add value to it, as well as increase 
user functionality. Future plans include:

- adding the Stack Overflow Jobs RSS feed
- intergrating the Glassdoor API with company reviews
- adding more content to the home page
<<<<<<< HEAD
- adding more page links with useful job search data
